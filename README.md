## Network Monitoring and Anomaly Detection Tool with Python and Scapy

## Project Description
I developed a tool to monitor and detect anomalies in network packets using Python and the Scapy library. The script captures TCP packets, identifies anomalies and generates a detailed CSV report. It also records the anomalies in a log file for local monitoring.

## Main Features
- Capture and analysis of TCP packets
- Identification and recording of anomalies
- Generation of reports in CSV format
- Local recording of anomalies for monitoring

## Skills Developed
- Python programming
- Network packet analysis with Scapy
- Handling and generating CSV files
- Python logging for local monitoring

## Results Obtained
- Successful implementation of an efficient network monitoring system.
- Real-time notification of possible network anomalies.
- Improved ability to respond to security incidents.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kleberfernandes010/Network_Anomaly_Detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Network_Anomaly_Detection`
3. Run the script: `sudo python capture_packages.py`
4. Check the `anomalies.log` and `report.csv` files for the anomalies detected.
